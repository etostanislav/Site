# Wages Counter

People who work different number of hours per week often pay different tax and insurance contributions. It often happens
 that a few months after the beginning of the financial year, an employee may not know what percentage he paid and 
 whether he can expect that part of the tax paid will be refunded at the end of the year. 
 Wages Counter App helps you keep accurate hours and automatically calculates taxes and ACC deductions for each work week. 
 The App also allows you to generate an annual report to find out how the amount of taxes paid differs from the correct amount 
 based on the total annual income.
 
Stored data can be updated and deleted by user

**Current working version of the application deployed on AWS and available to review [at this link](http://wagescounter1-env.eba-cmi3brvm.ap-southeast-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/)**
